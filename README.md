See the difference between this code and the [Twin Peaksbrary Rails App](https://github.com/meryldakin/twin-peaksbrary).

# XML HTTP Request
# Breakdown of an XHR Request

## 1. The client sends an XML HTTP request
The client is the browser or whatever is making the request.

## 2. The server composes some type of response
The server composes a response. The response is typically composed of HTML, JSON, XML etc

## 3. The server sends back the response

## 4. The client by default, does nothing with the response
Its up to us to programmatically (with JS) tell the client what to do with the response
